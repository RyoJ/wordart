Interview survey
Conduct of interview
By December 7, 2016 (Tuesday), we interviewed up to 12 people and collected voice data of interviews for 7 people. The remaining six interviews were omitted because no valid data were obtained for this study.
Each of them answered 5 questions about the question based on principal component analysis. As a result, while having a common understanding of the law, unique ideas and actions were found based on personal experience. The details are described in the following “5.2.2 Summary of SCAT analysis”.
In addition, an interview survey with SCAT analysis is included in the appendix.
