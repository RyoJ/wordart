Task
This survey of "the awareness and background about infringing on the rights of others" made it possible to clarify the difference between the way of thinking of the law and the way of thinking of the general public. "The idea of ​​the law" is "the idea of ​​determining monogot according to what is prescribed by the law", and "the idea of ​​the general public" is "assuming various conditions from clear things to not clear things, It is "coordinating thinking" that it is trying not to show a problem in the range of act.
"The way of thinking of the law" is simple because it imposes and keeps the rules, so it is simple but does not involve in the personal situation. On the contrary, "thought of the general public" is properly adjusted for the individual, but many of these parts are by manners and morals, and are not regulated by the law, so various rights may be violated in this part. There is also sex.
From this study, it can be considered that this part is due to differences in thinking based on personal experience, when coordination thinking does not go well. It is usually thought that problems will gradually penetrate as various problems arise, and eventually they will converge
However, as described in the background, in the modern information society, "the number of arrests of cybercrime is ever increasing." From now on, approaches in various fields are essential, including information education to reconcile the reduction of cybercrime simultaneously with the development of the information society.
